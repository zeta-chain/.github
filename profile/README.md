[ZetaChain](https://www.zetachain.com/) is a blockchain focused on
interoperability. It provides an EVM-based platform for developers to build and
deploy omnichain contracts, which can be called from any connected chain,
including Bitcoin. It also supports cross-chain messaging between connected
chains.

### Build an Omnichain dApp

### Contribute to the Project

ZetaChain's blockchain node implements the core protocol, written in Go using
Cosmos SDK and Comet BFT. Protocol contracts implement the core protocol and are
deployed on ZetaChain and on connected chains, written in Solidity. See the list
of pinned repos below for the projects to contribute to.
